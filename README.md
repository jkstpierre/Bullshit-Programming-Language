# *The Bull$hit! Programming Language*

## Introduction
Bull$hit! is an esoteric programming language designed for one purpose: to infuriate you.
Inspired in part by its spritual neighbor Brainfuck, Bull$shit! stretches the bounds of computational usability to utterly outrageous lengths. 
It is repetitive, it is tedious, and it is boring, but from these tribulations it is hoped that you, the clever programmer, shall learn to overcome them and
truly appreciate the great lengths to which modern languages assist you in your day-to-day life.

Best of wishes to you and your computational journey ahead.

Sincerely,   
*J.K.S*

## Language Overview
### Computational Process
In Bull$hit!, programs consist of the manipulation of three distinct variables:
1. A square 2D array of 32-bit signed integers of size N^2 to be specified at the start of the program. This array plays the role of main memory for the program, and every cell is initialized to zero.
2. A (y,x) tuple representing the index of the cell in memory currently being pointed to.
3. A 32-bit signed integer called *curr_value* to be used for arithmetic.
